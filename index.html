	<p>I met Star Trek via some books that I bought at a garage sale.</p>

	<p>
		To a Trek lover who grew up on the TV shows, this may seem odd: someone
		became a Trek fan via <em>books</em>? But books are beta canon! Well, yes,
		it’s true: I fell in love with the universe after meeting it through some books
		that described the adventures of the TNG and TOS crews.

		This site is my way of returning to Trek via the medium where I first met it.
		By writing critically about Star Trek, I hope to solidify my own thoughts about
		a franchise for which my passions run deep. It’s a place to document my own
		journey with a show that so many love. Welcome!
